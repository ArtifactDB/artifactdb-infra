**Maciej Aniol** is our DevOps expert in our ArtifactDB team and has implemented a lot of the components described in
this document, using Terraform, Terragrunt and whatever is necessary to get the job done. Some important notes he wrote
can be found the `artifactdb-infra` repository as well, to complement this content with more specific and technical
details.
